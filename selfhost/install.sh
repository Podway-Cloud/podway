   What you just got: your own always-on cloud for AI coding agents. Open the
   dashboard and launch a pod — a ready-to-use cloud computer where Claude Code
   (or Codex) lives, keeps your project files, runs servers, and keeps working
   even when your laptop is closed.

   First, sign in:
     • New install → you'll create your owner login (pick a password). That's it.
     • Installed here before? Sign in with the password you already set.
       Forgot it, or want a clean slate?  cd $DIR && docker compose down -v
       (the -v erases everything — pods, data, and that login — so you start fresh.)

   Everyday commands (run inside ./$DIR):
     docker compose logs -f serve     # watch what podway is doing
     docker compose down              # stop podway — your data stays
     docker compose down -v           # stop AND erase all data

   Running this on a public server is still experimental — keep your dashboard
   private. Full guide: https://github.com/Podway-Cloud/install/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
   (Advanced: set PODWAY_AUTH_PASSWORD before starting to skip the setup screen.)
