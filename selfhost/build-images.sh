# Build + push the self-host images from a workstation with buildx (e.g. an M-series Mac:
# arm64 native + amd64 emulated) — an alternative to the selfhost-images GitHub workflow that
# spends no CI minutes. Produces one multi-arch manifest per image, pushed to ghcr.
#
#   docker login ghcr.io -u <your-gh-user>      # once, with a PAT that has write:packages
#   ./build-images.sh                            # both images, pushed to every OWNERS namespace
#   ./build-images.sh pod-app                    # just the dashboard/daemon image
#   OWNERS=podway-cloud PLATFORMS=linux/arm64 ./build-images.sh pod-base   # single namespace, arm64-only
#
# OWNERS is a SPACE-SEPARATED list of ghcr namespaces; each image is tagged into all of them in one
# build. During the velsa→podway-cloud transition the default is BOTH, so existing installs (pinned
# ghcr.io/velsa/*) and new installs (ghcr.io/podway-cloud/*) both keep pulling. Drop `velsa` from the
# list once the deprecation window closes (see docs/plans/ghcr-namespace-migration.md).
#
# NOTE: pod-base fetches from postgresql.org / nodesource / etc. during its build — run it on a
# network WITHOUT HTTPS interception (a corp VPN breaks cert verification). pod-app is lighter.
# After the first push a new package is PRIVATE — make it public once in GitHub so compose can pull it.
