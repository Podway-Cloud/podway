# Podway, self-hosted

**Keep Claude working on hardware you control.**

Podway runs Claude Code in a persistent Docker workspace with your project, tools, services, and
data. Sign in once, then work from the official Claude apps on desktop or mobile while the pod keeps
the computer—and your work—running. It uses your existing Claude Pro or Max subscription, so you do
not need an Anthropic API key or pay Podway a separate agent-usage bill.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Podway Self-Hosted is an early alpha.** It is released for local experiments and early feedback,
> but expect rough edges and occasional breaking changes. The public installer is available now;
> a buildable source release is being prepared.

## What you get

- **A workspace that stays put.** Your project, tools, and agent live together in one pod instead
  of being recreated for every session.
- **Claude in the official apps.** Podway starts Claude Remote Control after sign-in, so the same
  pod session is available from Claude on desktop and mobile.
- **A capable development environment.** Install packages, run Postgres, keep workers and dev
  servers running, schedule recurring agent work, and open the result through an app preview.
- **Work that continues.** Ask Claude to keep an app and its workers available, run a report every
  week, watch a source for meaningful changes, or recover a service that stopped.
- **Project access without secrets in chat.** Add credentials in the dashboard when Claude asks for
  them, then let the project use that access without pasting values into the conversation.
- **Control over the machine.** Pods run as Docker containers on your computer or server, using
  its storage and network connection.

## Install Podway

You need Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Compose v2, at least 8 GB of memory, about 6 GB of
free disk space, and a Claude Pro or Max subscription. The installer works from macOS and Linux
shells, or from WSL2 on Windows.

```sh
curl -fsSL podway.io/install.sh | sh
```

The installer checks your machine, downloads the Compose configuration into `./podway`, and pulls
the Podway images. First startup takes longer while those images download.

When it finishes, the installer prints the **real URL for your setup** — it auto-detects where it's
running:

- **Your laptop / a private box** → `http://localhost:8080`.
- **A public server, no domain** → a public HTTPS URL via [sslip.io](https://sslip.io), e.g.
  `https://<your-ip>.sslip.io` — pods get their own `https://<pod>.<your-ip>.sslip.io` preview, with
  automatic Let's Encrypt certificates. Just open ports 80 and 443.
- **A public server with a domain** → dashboard + per-pod preview subdomains on your domain, HTTPS
  automatic (set `PODWAY_DOMAIN=yourdomain`; the installer prints the two DNS records to add).
- **A server already running nginx/Caddy/Traefik on 80/443** → podway coexists behind it and prints
  a snippet to add to that proxy — no port fight.

Then:

1. Open the URL the installer printed (or [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) locally).
2. Create the single owner login. This protects the dashboard and administrative terminal.
3. Select **Create a pod** and choose a playbook or workspace.
4. Follow the sign-in link and enter the code from your Claude account.
5. Once Claude is signed in, open the pod session from the official Claude desktop or mobile app.

From then on, Claude is the main interface. Return to the Podway dashboard when you want to manage
the pod, add secrets, inspect health, or open an app preview. A browser terminal remains available
as an advanced recovery tool.

Review the public [`install.sh`](https://github.com/podway-cloud/podway/blob/main/selfhost/install.sh) and
[`compose.yaml`](https://github.com/podway-cloud/podway/blob/main/selfhost/compose.yaml), then run:

```sh
mkdir podway && cd podway
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/podway-cloud/podway/main/selfhost/compose.yaml -o compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

## Know before you deploy

- **This is a single-owner edition.** The built-in login protects the dashboard and administrative
  terminal; it is not a multi-user access-control system.
- **Local or private-network use is still recommended.** Remote deployment is experimental, pod
  ports need Docker-aware firewall rules, and app-preview links currently work only on the Docker
  host. Read the deployment and security guides before using a server.
- **The host must remain online.** A pod cannot keep working while its Docker host is asleep or
  disconnected.
- **A pod is not a backup.** Deleting a pod deletes its container and workspace. Commit important
  work to Git or export it first.
- **Podway has powerful host access.** The dashboard controls Docker so it can create and manage
  pods. Only run it on a machine where you trust the people who can reach the dashboard.

## Documentation

- [Podway docs](https://podway.cloud/docs) — what Claude can accomplish, how to ask for recurring
  work, and how to manage previews, skills, secrets, and recovery
- [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) — supported hosts, ports, private access, remote-host guidance,
  and configuration
- [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md) — logs, updates, backups, stopping, uninstalling, and common
  problems
- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — the containers, networks, data, and trust boundaries
- [Security](docs/SECURITY.md) — current limitations, exposure risks, secrets, and reporting a
  vulnerability

## Source and licensing

The buildable self-hosted source is being prepared for publication. It will include the dashboard,
local control plane, gateway, pod agent, Docker provider, default environments, image build files,
and the tests needed to reproduce the published images. Podway's managed-cloud orchestration and
operator tooling will remain separate.

Until that source and its license are published, this repository is the public self-hosted
installer—not the source distribution.
