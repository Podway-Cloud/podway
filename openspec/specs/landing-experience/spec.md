# landing-experience Specification

## Purpose
Defines the public landing page: an outcome-led narrative with distinct sections, rotating illustrative build examples, a starter catalog, and subscription positioning, presented truthfully without overstating unavailable capabilities. It ensures the page is responsive, respects reduced-motion and keyboard navigation, carries proper metadata, and emits interaction analytics that degrade gracefully when no backend is present.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Stable self-host landing
The public site SHALL expose a self-host-focused landing at `/selfhost` with its own canonical
metadata. The page SHALL present Claude as the operator, Podway as the persistent computer and
prepared operating environment, official Claude desktop and mobile apps as the normal interface,
and the visitor's existing Claude Pro or Max subscription as the agent subscription.

The page SHALL distinguish Podway Cloud from the self-hosted edition, link the latter to the public
Podway source repository, and qualify Podway as early alpha. Its availability at `/selfhost` SHALL NOT
depend on whether administrators also promote it to `/`.

The route SHALL resolve authentication at request time so returning cloud users see their account
and dashboard actions rather than an anonymously cached page. In the OSS edition, `/selfhost` SHALL
redirect to the dashboard instead of exposing cloud marketing metadata on the owner's installation.
When the page is promoted to `/`, the root title, description, canonical URL, Open Graph, and Twitter
metadata SHALL describe the self-host experience rendered in the body.

After the operating contract and before the hosting choice, the page SHALL show an attributable
horizontal feed of public self-host maintenance reports for the apps in the supported catalog. Each
report SHALL name its public author and platform, link to the original GitHub issue or Reddit
thread, pause while a visitor interacts with it, and become a manually scrollable snap row when
reduced motion is requested.

Immediately after the supported-app catalog, the page SHALL present the product's operating
contract: upstream release and security monitoring, automatic application of updates that pass
clone-based testing, owner approval for risky or breaking changes, and one-click return to the
last-good state. This contract is the implementation target for the self-hosted AI-admin product.

#### Scenario: Visitor opens the secondary self-host landing
- **WHEN** a visitor opens `/selfhost`
- **THEN** the page SHALL render the self-host positioning, supported-app outcomes, hosting choices,
  early-alpha qualification, Claude subscription message, and Cloud and self-host calls to action

#### Scenario: Homepage promotion is disabled
- **GIVEN** an administrator has chosen Keep only at `/selfhost`
- **WHEN** a visitor opens `/selfhost`
- **THEN** the self-host landing SHALL remain available with `/selfhost` as its canonical URL

#### Scenario: Returning user opens the self-host landing
- **GIVEN** a cloud user is signed in
- **WHEN** they open `/selfhost`
- **THEN** the request-time page SHALL show their account and dashboard actions rather than anonymous
  access-request actions

#### Scenario: Self-host owner opens the marketing path
- **GIVEN** Podway is running in the OSS edition
- **WHEN** the owner opens `/selfhost`
- **THEN** they SHALL be redirected to the dashboard

#### Scenario: Self-host landing owns the homepage
- **GIVEN** an administrator has promoted the self-host landing to `/`
- **WHEN** a crawler or visitor opens `/`
- **THEN** the root metadata and rendered body SHALL both describe the self-host experience while the
  canonical URL remains `https://podway.io/`

#### Scenario: Visitor evaluates operational trust
- **WHEN** a visitor finishes the supported-app catalog
- **THEN** the page SHALL explain the monitoring, safe-patching, approval, and rollback contract
  before showing maintenance reports and hosting choices

#### Scenario: Visitor evaluates the hidden cost of self-hosting
- **WHEN** a visitor moves from the operating contract toward the hosting choice
- **THEN** the page SHALL show source-linked reports about the supported apps from real self-hosters
  in a horizontal feed without inventing identities or presenting the reporters as Podway customers

### Requirement: A signed-in visitor is shown the way back to their machines

When a signed-in user views the landing page, the primary navigation SHALL present their account mark
— their avatar, or their initial when they have no image — as part of the link to the dashboard.

A plain "Dashboard" text link reads as site navigation rather than as *their* account, so a returning
user hunts for the way back into their own pods. The mark is also the signal that they are already
signed in, which the page otherwise states nowhere.

The mark SHALL be part of the same link, not adjacent to it, and SHALL NOT increase the height of the
navigation row.

#### Scenario: Signed-in visitor on the landing page

- **WHEN** a signed-in user loads the landing page
- **THEN** the navigation SHALL show their avatar or initial within the dashboard link, and the
  navigation row SHALL be no taller than it is for an anonymous visitor

### Requirement: Outcome-led landing narrative
The `outcomes` bundle SHALL preserve the stable headline “Build the idea. Skip the setup.” while
describing removed infrastructure burden without promising literally zero setup. The
`agent-computer` bundle SHALL lead with the benefit that work continues after the visitor's laptop
closes and explain the always-on computer that enables it. The `agent-home` bundle SHALL lead with
a capable home the agent knows how to use and immediately decode that metaphor into project,
services, recurring work, and a live address. Each bundle SHALL expose its primary access CTA in
the first viewport.

#### Scenario: Visitor reads the outcomes first viewport
- **GIVEN** the `outcomes` variant is rendered
- **WHEN** a visitor opens the landing page
- **THEN** the first viewport SHALL identify the build outcome, handled infrastructure setup,
  primary access CTA, and representative conceptual proof without claiming that every user action
  or credential step disappears

#### Scenario: Visitor reads the agent-computer first viewport
- **GIVEN** the `agent-computer` variant is rendered
- **WHEN** a visitor opens the landing page
- **THEN** the first viewport SHALL state that the coding agent keeps working after the visitor's
  laptop closes, identify native Claude desktop and mobile apps as the normal control surfaces,
  identify the always-on cloud computer that connects them, include the primary access CTA, and
  make bring-your-own-subscription behavior visible without scrolling

#### Scenario: Visitor interprets the Agent Computer hero visual
- **GIVEN** the `agent-computer` first viewport is displayed
- **WHEN** the visitor scans the continuity walkthrough
- **THEN** Claude Desktop and Claude Mobile SHALL carry all task narrative, questions, and results,
  the pod SHALL communicate only real lifecycle and Remote Control state, and terminal access SHALL
  NOT appear as a peer or primary workflow

#### Scenario: Continuity sequence remains legible across viewports
- **GIVEN** the `agent-computer` continuity walkthrough is displayed
- **WHEN** the visitor follows the desktop, pod, and phone sequence
- **THEN** “Start on desktop”, “Pod runs 24/7”, and “Continue on phone” SHALL appear as external
  narrative steps, the always-on Podway virtual workspace SHALL be the visually emphasized center
  stage rather than a closed laptop, one project line SHALL connect the desktop, pod, and phone, and
  the diagram SHALL use transparent outer space without a surrounding card or frame and SHALL
  remain a compact supporting proof rather than filling the wide content area;
  narrow viewports SHALL preserve the same labeled order without horizontal overflow

#### Scenario: Abstract Claude continuity diagram crosses devices
- **GIVEN** the Agent Computer continuity visual uses abstract conversation shapes without invented
  customer, project, or outcome data
- **WHEN** the visitor follows the session from desktop to phone
- **THEN** the center substrate SHALL be visibly identified as a Podway workspace and the diagram
  MAY omit a conceptual-data disclaimer because it does not present customer activity or output

#### Scenario: Continuity substrate stays visually quiet
- **GIVEN** the Agent Computer continuity diagram is displayed
- **WHEN** the visitor scans the center workspace
- **THEN** decorative top telemetry SHALL be omitted and the status line SHALL use the Podway mark
  beside the always-on state

#### Scenario: Visitor reads the agent-home first viewport
- **GIVEN** the `agent-home` variant is rendered
- **WHEN** a visitor opens the landing page
- **THEN** the first viewport SHALL promise a home the agent knows how to use and SHALL visualize
  one request becoming a running application with local data, prepared recurring work, and a
  private live address

### Requirement: Distinct section responsibilities
The landing page SHALL use a lean narrative in which the hero, starter catalog, concrete capability
proof, differentiation, and closing CTA each add new information rather than restating the hero
promise.

Public-facing landing prose, labels, alternative text, and metadata SHALL NOT use em dash
punctuation.

#### Scenario: Visitor scans the full page
- **GIVEN** the landing page is rendered
- **WHEN** the visitor moves from one section to the next
- **THEN** each section SHALL answer a distinct question about relevance, product substance,
  differentiation, or next action

#### Scenario: Landing copy is rendered
- **GIVEN** any landing variant or its metadata is rendered
- **WHEN** a visitor reads its public-facing copy
- **THEN** the copy SHALL express pauses and contrasts without the em dash character

#### Scenario: Visitor sees the whole-project capability
- **GIVEN** the `agent-computer` capability section is displayed
- **WHEN** the visitor scans the runtime, application, and delivery states
- **THEN** the page SHALL explain that a pod can run development servers, databases, background
  workers, scheduled jobs, monitors, and project-specific skills; SHALL explain that a pod can be
  used for development with a live preview or can run the production server directly; and SHALL
  depict separate pods for research, development, scheduled work, and production

#### Scenario: Visitor interprets the pod fleet
- **GIVEN** the whole-project pod network is displayed
- **WHEN** the visitor scans the separate pod roles and their connections
- **THEN** the diagram SHALL keep every pod role legible without animation, SHALL depict moving
  packets as durable owner-scoped messages rather than direct network or filesystem access, and
  SHALL hide the moving packets when the visitor requests reduced motion

### Requirement: Without/with comparison is bounded by the rest of the page

The landing page MAY carry a comparison of working without a pod against working with one. Every
claim in it SHALL restate a claim the page already makes in a section of its own; a comparison SHALL
NOT introduce a capability that appears nowhere else.

A comparison table is the easiest place on a landing page to drift into a promise the product does
not keep — the format invites a tidy pairing more than it invites accuracy — so the constraint is
structural: unbacked row, no row. This is the same bar as "Truthful product proof", applied where it
is easiest to breach.

The comparison SHALL frame the difference as one of ENVIRONMENT, not of tool. The agent is the same
in both columns; what changes is where it runs. The "without" column SHALL read as context rather
than as a competitor being disparaged.

It SHALL remain legible on a phone. A three-column comparison cannot stay readable at that width, so
it SHALL restructure rather than scroll horizontally, and each value SHALL keep a visible label for
which side it belongs to once the column headers are gone.

#### Scenario: A row has no supporting section

- **WHEN** a comparison row states a capability not covered elsewhere on the page
- **THEN** that row SHALL be removed or the capability SHALL be given its own section

#### Scenario: The page is read on a phone

- **WHEN** the viewport is too narrow for the comparison's columns
- **THEN** each row SHALL stack with its own labels, and the page SHALL NOT scroll horizontally

### Requirement: Rotating build examples
The `outcomes` control hero SHALL preserve its deterministic sequence of useful-app, automation,
and bot examples while keeping the headline, supporting copy, layout dimensions, and CTA stable.
The sequence SHALL provide manual selection and SHALL NOT randomize the initial example. The
`agent-computer` treatment SHALL NOT reuse this conceptual rotation as its primary proof.

#### Scenario: Automatic control example progression
- **GIVEN** the `outcomes` variant is rendered, motion is allowed, and the visitor has not
  interacted with the example
- **WHEN** the hero remains visible for the configured hold period
- **THEN** the example SHALL progress in a fixed order and its matching outcome visual SHALL appear
  without moving or obscuring surrounding content

#### Scenario: Visitor selects a control example
- **GIVEN** the `outcomes` example controls are visible
- **WHEN** the visitor selects the app, automation, or bot control
- **THEN** the chosen copy and matching outcome visual SHALL appear and automatic progression SHALL
  pause

#### Scenario: Control example is not a launch input
- **GIVEN** prompt-first project launch is unavailable
- **WHEN** the visitor sees the typed control example
- **THEN** it SHALL be presented as an example of directing an agent and SHALL NOT appear to submit
  or launch a project from the landing page

### Requirement: Starter catalog
Landing bundles that present playbooks SHALL derive availability from the current catalog plus an
explicit release-readiness gate. A launchable card SHALL represent a playbook that is both present
and release-ready; a pilot SHALL be visibly unavailable and SHALL NOT link to a launch action. The
`outcomes` and `agent-computer` bundles SHALL use consistent readiness for the same playbook.

#### Scenario: Visitor evaluates launchable starting points
- **GIVEN** Bring Your Project and Ask Your Docs are present and release-ready
- **WHEN** either catalog-bearing landing bundle renders their cards
- **THEN** the cards SHALL be identified as ready and SHALL link to the applicable sign-in or launch
  action

#### Scenario: Visitor evaluates pilot starting points
- **GIVEN** First 10 Customers or Morning Ops Robot has not passed its release gate
- **WHEN** either catalog-bearing landing bundle renders that playbook
- **THEN** it SHALL be visibly identified as a pilot or unavailable and SHALL NOT link to a launch
  action

### Requirement: Truthful product proof
Primary landing graphics SHALL be visibly distinguishable as real product captures, real playbook
outputs, conceptual examples, or simulated walkthroughs. Repeated imagery SHALL not be used merely
to inflate proof density. All public claims SHALL match behavior available at release. The page
SHALL NOT fabricate customer proof, usage metrics, managed production infrastructure, client
support, session retention, malicious-skill prevention, egress protection, or starter availability.

#### Scenario: Conceptual outcome is displayed
- **GIVEN** an illustrative mockup rather than captured product output is used
- **WHEN** a visitor views the visual
- **THEN** a visual containing invented application, project, or customer output SHALL include a
  persistent readable cue that it is conceptual and SHALL NOT attribute the outcome to a customer;
  a clearly abstract relationship diagram without such data MAY omit the cue

#### Scenario: Simulated workspace walkthrough is displayed
- **GIVEN** a landing shows continuity, local services, recurring work, or live-preview behavior
  with invented project content
- **WHEN** the visual is published
- **THEN** shipped Podway behavior SHALL support the depicted capability and the visual SHALL
  identify the project data as simulated

#### Scenario: A named capability is unavailable
- **GIVEN** Codex parity, native-client reach, arbitrary terminal access, always-on behavior,
  scheduling, local Postgres, public/private preview, or a named playbook is not production-ready
- **WHEN** landing copy and availability language are reviewed
- **THEN** the unavailable claim SHALL be removed, explicitly qualified, or the affected bundle
  SHALL remain blocked from measured delivery

### Requirement: Subscription positioning
All three variants SHALL state that users bring their own supported agent subscription and that
Podway uses the official CLI without token markup. The `agent-computer` and `agent-home` bundles
SHALL make the existing-subscription behavior visible in the first viewport, while the official-CLI
and no-token-markup distinctions MAY appear later in the `agent-computer` page. No variant SHALL
imply pooled subscriptions, modified official CLIs, model-auth proxying, or control over vendor
billing.

#### Scenario: Agent-computer or agent-home visitor reads the first viewport
- **GIVEN** the `agent-computer` or `agent-home` variant is rendered
- **WHEN** the first viewport is displayed
- **THEN** it SHALL state that Podway hosts the workspace while the visitor uses the supported
  subscription they already pay for; the `agent-computer` first-viewport reassurance MAY present
  that message without secondary API-key, usage-markup, or qualified agent-support lines

#### Scenario: Runtime application requires separate model credentials
- **GIVEN** a playbook's deployed application requires an API key in addition to the coding-agent
  subscription
- **WHEN** that playbook is described
- **THEN** the page SHALL NOT imply that application runtime usage is included in the coding-agent
  subscription

#### Scenario: Visitor reads subscription differentiation
- **GIVEN** the visitor reaches the differentiation content
- **WHEN** subscription behavior is described
- **THEN** the copy SHALL distinguish the Podway workspace from the user's existing AI
  subscription without making an unverified vendor claim

### Requirement: Responsive and accessible motion
The landing page SHALL remain usable and visually coherent from 320px mobile through wide desktop,
with keyboard-accessible controls, visible focus, stable media dimensions, meaningful alternative
text, and a reduced-motion experience that disables typing and autoplay.

#### Scenario: Visitor prefers reduced motion
- **GIVEN** the browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- **WHEN** the landing page loads
- **THEN** one stable example SHALL be shown without typing or autoplay and manual selection SHALL
  remain available

#### Scenario: Visitor uses keyboard navigation
- **GIVEN** the visitor navigates without a pointer
- **WHEN** focus reaches example or CTA controls
- **THEN** each control SHALL expose its purpose and state, show visible focus, and operate from the
  keyboard

#### Scenario: Visitor opens a narrow viewport
- **GIVEN** the viewport is 320px wide
- **WHEN** the landing page renders and examples change
- **THEN** text, controls, visuals, and CTA SHALL remain readable without horizontal overflow or
  incoherent overlap

### Requirement: Landing metadata
The canonical landing page SHALL publish one stable, truthful metadata description independent of
random experiment assignment. Forced-preview routes SHALL not compete with the canonical landing
page in search indexes. Public discovery URLs, canonical URLs, and structured-data identifiers SHALL
use `https://podway.io`; the retired application origin SHALL NOT be published as the canonical site.
Organization and software-application structured data SHALL be scoped to the public acquisition and
self-host landings rather than inherited by authenticated or internal application routes. Both
landings SHALL provide explicit Open Graph and Twitter images for link previews.

#### Scenario: Canonical landing metadata is rendered
- **GIVEN** a crawler or link preview requests `/`
- **WHEN** title, description, and canonical metadata are produced
- **THEN** they SHALL identify Podway as an always-on cloud workspace for coding agents, mention the
  supported bring-your-own-subscription model, use `https://podway.io/` as the canonical URL, and
  publish complete Open Graph, Twitter, Organization, and SoftwareApplication metadata

#### Scenario: Public landing footer identifies the canonical brand domain
- **WHEN** a visitor reaches the footer of a public landing page
- **THEN** its visible brand-domain label SHALL read `podway.io`; operational email addresses MAY
  continue using a separately configured mail domain

#### Scenario: Preview metadata is rendered
- **GIVEN** a crawler requests a semantic preview route
- **WHEN** metadata is produced
- **THEN** it SHALL include `noindex` and identify `/` as canonical

### Requirement: Landing interaction event contract
The landing experience SHALL expose stable, variant-aware analytics events for experiment exposure,
primary CTA activation, and variant-specific interactions through a non-blocking same-origin
adapter. Every primary CTA in all three measured bundles SHALL be instrumented. Event delivery SHALL
remain safe for navigation when the ingestion backend is absent or unavailable.

#### Scenario: Analytics backend is unavailable
- **GIVEN** the landing event endpoint cannot accept an event
- **WHEN** a visitor triggers an instrumented interaction
- **THEN** navigation and interaction SHALL complete normally without surfacing an error

#### Scenario: Instrumented interaction occurs
- **GIVEN** an eligible assigned visitor activates a primary CTA, selects an outcomes example, or
  selects a presented playbook
- **WHEN** the adapter submits the event
- **THEN** it SHALL persist the active experiment identifier, semantic variant, stable event name,
  and selected item identifier when applicable

### Requirement: Agent-home landing narrative
The `agent-home` landing concept SHALL lead with Podway as a persistent, capable place the coding
agent understands and can operate. It SHALL explain the metaphor with concrete workspace
capabilities before introducing always-on infrastructure, prepared playbooks, or marketplace
content.

#### Scenario: Visitor reads the agent-home first viewport
- **GIVEN** the `agent-home` landing is rendered
- **WHEN** a visitor opens the page
- **THEN** the first viewport SHALL contain the “A home your agent knows how to use” promise, name
  concrete capabilities available in that home, present one primary access CTA, and show one
  request becoming a running system

#### Scenario: Visitor scans beyond the hero
- **GIVEN** the visitor continues through the `agent-home` page
- **WHEN** each section enters the reading order
- **THEN** the sections SHALL separately establish capability, reduced assembly work,
  differentiation, ownership, and the final action without adding a playbook catalog

### Requirement: Agent-home conversion hierarchy
The `agent-home` page SHALL make “Give my agent a home” the dominant signed-out action and SHALL
reduce uncertainty near that action with accurate access, authentication, and subscription cues.
Signed-in visitors SHALL receive the existing dashboard action.

#### Scenario: Signed-out visitor evaluates the primary action
- **GIVEN** a signed-out visitor sees the first viewport
- **WHEN** they evaluate the primary CTA
- **THEN** the CTA SHALL visually dominate secondary navigation and SHALL be accompanied by a clear
  private-alpha, GitHub-sign-in, own-subscription, and official-CLI expectation

#### Scenario: Signed-in visitor evaluates the primary action
- **GIVEN** an authenticated visitor sees the `agent-home` page
- **WHEN** they evaluate the primary CTA or account navigation
- **THEN** both SHALL lead back to the dashboard rather than presenting an alpha-access request

### Requirement: Agent-home capability proof
The primary `agent-home` graphic SHALL use one coherent simulated project to demonstrate an
application, local Postgres, prepared recurring work, and an owner-only live URL in the same
workspace. The page SHALL visually and textually identify the demonstration as simulated product
data.

#### Scenario: Visitor interprets the hero graphic
- **GIVEN** the visitor sees the request-to-running-system graphic
- **WHEN** they scan its statuses and result
- **THEN** they SHALL be able to identify what the visitor requested, what the agent configured,
  the access boundary of the URL, and the completed result without relying on animation

#### Scenario: Visitor interprets infrastructure scope
- **GIVEN** the page describes Postgres, recurring work, or a live URL
- **WHEN** the visitor reads the associated proof or differentiation content
- **THEN** the page SHALL NOT describe the local database as managed production infrastructure,
  the preview as a production deployment, or scheduling as universally configured for every pod

### Requirement: Agent-home responsive and accessible presentation
The `agent-home` layout SHALL remain coherent from 320px through wide desktop, preserve a visible
primary CTA and readable proof hierarchy, provide visible keyboard focus, and communicate all
status without depending on color or motion.

#### Scenario: Visitor uses a narrow mobile viewport
- **GIVEN** the viewport is 320px wide
- **WHEN** the `agent-home` page renders
- **THEN** the hero copy, CTA, request, capability statuses, URL, and section content SHALL remain
  readable without horizontal page overflow

#### Scenario: Visitor prefers reduced motion
- **GIVEN** the browser reports `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- **WHEN** the `agent-home` page loads
- **THEN** nonessential animation SHALL be disabled while every capability and completion state
  remains visible

#### Scenario: Visitor navigates with a keyboard
- **GIVEN** the visitor uses keyboard navigation
- **WHEN** focus reaches navigation or CTA links
- **THEN** each link SHALL show a visible focus indicator and expose a meaningful accessible name
