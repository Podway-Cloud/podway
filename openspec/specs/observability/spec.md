# observability Specification

## Purpose
Requires the gateway, pod-agent, and provider to emit structured logs for key events and failures, so operators can trace rejected and accepted sessions, pod-agent lifecycle, and Fly API errors. It also mandates that pod server actions fail gracefully and that unexpected errors render a branded error page.
## Requirements
### Requirement: A metrics client works against older pods

The control plane SHALL read metrics successfully from pods running an EARLIER pod-agent, degrading
what it asks for rather than failing.

Pods update on the owner's schedule, so at any moment the fleet spans several agent versions. A
request shape only newer agents understand — a query parameter an older one cannot route — is answered
404, and the surface then reports that metrics are unavailable while the pod holds a full history. The
data being present makes this worse, not better: nothing looks broken on the pod, so the search starts
in the wrong place.

Where a narrower request is refused, the client SHALL retry the form every version understands and
narrow the result itself.

#### Scenario: A pod that has not been updated

- **WHEN** metrics are requested for a window from a pod whose agent predates windowed requests
- **THEN** the full history SHALL be fetched and narrowed by the client, and charts SHALL render

### Requirement: Services emit structured logs

The gateway, pod-agent, and provider SHALL emit structured JSON-line logs to stdout with at
least `ts`, `level`, `svc`, and `event` fields, plus relevant context (`podId`, `userId`,
`err`). Secrets and tokens SHALL never appear in log output.

#### Scenario: Gateway logs a rejected upgrade

- **WHEN** a WebSocket upgrade is rejected (unauthenticated, pod not found, pod won't start,
  upstream unreachable)
- **THEN** the gateway SHALL log one event naming the reason and HTTP status used

#### Scenario: Gateway logs an accepted session

- **WHEN** a client successfully attaches to a pod
- **THEN** the gateway SHALL log the attach (and later the detach) with pod and user context

#### Scenario: pod-agent logs its lifecycle

- **WHEN** the pod-agent starts, creates the tmux session, gains/loses a client, or sees the
  PTY exit
- **THEN** it SHALL log each event, so `fly logs` on the pods app explains what a pod did

#### Scenario: Provider logs Fly API failures

- **WHEN** a Fly API call is retried or fails terminally
- **THEN** the provider SHALL log the method, path, status, and attempt — with no token material

### Requirement: Pod server actions fail gracefully

Every pod-mutating server action SHALL catch errors, log them, and return a typed error result
instead of throwing to the framework error boundary.

#### Scenario: Delete fails mid-flight

- **WHEN** `destroyPod` hits a provider error
- **THEN** the dashboard stays functional and shows the error message inline

#### Scenario: Launch fails

- **WHEN** `launchPod` fails (provider down, quota, bad environment)
- **THEN** the launcher shows the error and the user can retry without a page reload

### Requirement: Unexpected errors show a branded page

Unhandled render/server errors in the web app SHALL show a branded error page with a retry
control and the error digest, never the framework's default error text.

#### Scenario: Unexpected crash on a page

- **WHEN** an unhandled error occurs rendering any page
- **THEN** the user sees the podway error page with a "Try again" action and a digest they can
  report

### Requirement: A notification that does not go out is recorded

Sending an email or an ops alert is best-effort and MUST NOT break the action that raised it. It
MUST, however, be RECORDED when it fails: the send SHALL check the API's response, and a non-2xx
response or a thrown error SHALL be logged with enough context to identify the failure.

Two distinct faults made this invisible for weeks (found 2026-09-07). The sends were wrapped in a
bare catch, and — the more serious one — they never inspected the RESPONSE at all. A rejected send
returns a 401; it does not throw, so there was no error to swallow and the code proceeded as though
it had succeeded. A user signed up, saw success, and received nothing.

#### Scenario: The mail API rejects the send

- **WHEN** a send returns a non-2xx response
- **THEN** the failure SHALL be logged with the status, and the calling action SHALL still succeed

#### Scenario: A successful send

- **WHEN** a send is accepted
- **THEN** nothing SHALL be logged as a failure
