# Pre-deploy guard: does prod still owe any DB migration the repo has?
#
# The web image is a pruned Next standalone that CANNOT run migrations — only the gateway does, via
# its Fly release_command. So a web deploy that depends on a not-yet-applied migration ships broken
# (prod broke exactly this way on 0039: web selected pods.cpus/memory_mb before the column existed).
# This runs `migrate-prod --check` (read-only) against the prod DB and exits NONZERO if anything is
# pending, so deploy-app.sh can refuse `web` until `gateway` has been deployed first.
#
# Connectivity: podway-db is Fly-internal (podway-db.flycast), so we open a short-lived `fly proxy`
# tunnel and read DATABASE_URL from the gateway's env (never printed). Needs `fly` + the built
# packages/db/dist/migrate-prod.js. Emergency override lives in deploy-app.sh, not here.
