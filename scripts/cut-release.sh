# Cut a Podway release (release-versioning §3.1). A release = a pod-base image ship (image-only,
# per-ship — the settled §7 decisions), so cutting one does three things:
#   1. attaches the version LABEL to the CURRENT pod-base manifest image (the one just shipped),
#   2. tags the private repo `v<version>` and creates a GitHub Release with notes from CHANGELOG.md,
#   3. (deferred to §3.2/§4) the public mirror tag + releases.json — NOT done here yet.
#
# The version is the single source of truth in CHANGELOG.md's top `## X.Y.Z` heading and the matching
# git tag. There is no VERSION file and packages stay 0.0.0 — only the RELEASE is versioned.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/cut-release.sh              # cut the version at the top of CHANGELOG.md
#   scripts/cut-release.sh --dry-run    # print what it WOULD do, touch nothing
#   scripts/cut-release.sh 0.2.0        # assert the top CHANGELOG version is 0.2.0, then cut it
#
# Requires: ADMIN_API_TOKEN (Fly secret), gh authed with write on the private repo, clean tree at
# origin/main. RUNNING this publishes outward (a tag + a GitHub Release) — get the owner's yes first.
