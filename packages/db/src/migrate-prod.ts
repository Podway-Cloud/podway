 * Deploy-time migration runner (Fly `release_command`). Applies pending
 * `drizzle/*.sql` files to the production Postgres/Neon DB at DATABASE_URL, tracked
 * in a `podway_migrations` table so each runs exactly once. Idempotent: safe to run
 * on every deploy.
 *
 * Baselining: production was migrated by hand (direct SQL) up to BASELINE before
 * this runner existed, and those early migration files are not re-runnable
 * (CREATE TABLE without IF NOT EXISTS). So on the FIRST run (empty tracking table)
 * we RECORD everything through BASELINE as already-applied WITHOUT executing it, and
 * only execute migrations after it. From then on the tracking table is authoritative.
 *
 * Runs in the gateway image (which copies the whole workspace, so `pg` + the SQL
 * files are present). The web image is a pruned Next standalone and cannot run this.
