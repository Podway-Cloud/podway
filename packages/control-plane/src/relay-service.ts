 * pairing code (owner is signed in there); the GATEWAY redeems it (that is where the
 * relay's WebSocket lands) and records the connection. They share the database and
 * nothing else — so a code, and the fact that a relay is connected, have to be rows,
 * not memory.
 *
 * Nothing here records what the relay fetched. Traffic is read back from `fetch_memory`
 * (the `relay` rung), which is domain/outcome only — the same privacy boundary the
 * shared memory table already enforces. A relay's own fetch log stays on the owner's
 * machine, surfaced by `relay dashboard`, never shipped here.
