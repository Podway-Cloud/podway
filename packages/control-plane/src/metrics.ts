/**
 * Lifecycle metrics DERIVED from the append-only event log — nothing here is
 * stored (docs/plans/observability-plan.md). Fold the stream into intervals:
 * a `created`/`running` opens a RUNNING stretch, an OWNER suspend closes it into
 * a SUSPENDED stretch until the next `running`.
 *
 * The model is deliberately two-state — running vs suspended — because a Podway
 * pod runs 24/7 and the ONLY thing that legitimately stops it is the owner pressing
 * Suspend. It never sleeps itself. Everything else the log records about "down" time
 * is NOT off-time:
 *   - A platform restart (image update, resize, reboot) is recorded as
 *     `sleeping reason=reconciled` → `running`, but the pod was only restarting; that
 *     is normal operation, not the owner suspending, and it does NOT count as off.
 *   - The gap between a reconciler-observed sleep and the next observed wake is mostly
 *     UNOBSERVED time (reconcile only samples on page-load), so its duration is not
 *     even real downtime. Counting it as anything is a lie.
 * So reconciled/idle sleeps are ignored here entirely. Real trouble — an OOM, a crash,
 * a failed repair — is surfaced separately as an INCIDENT (see incidents.ts), shown as
 * a marker on the timeline, not folded into a suspended stretch of made-up length.
 *
 * Why derive rather than store: a counter updated on every transition drifts the
 * moment one write is missed (and ours are best-effort by design — observability
 * must never break a pod op). Replaying the log is always consistent with what we
 * actually observed, and it can be recomputed after a bug fix.
