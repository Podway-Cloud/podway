/**
 * OOM detection via cgroup v2 `memory.events` — the signal that IS readable inside an
 * Incus container.
 *
 * The old detector read `dmesg`, but a container cannot read the host kernel ring
 * buffer (`dmesg: read kernel buffer failed: Operation not permitted`) — even as root —
 * so on the entire Incus fleet `scan()` threw and silently recorded NOTHING. Verified
 * in prod 2026-08-04: a pod that OOM'd had 0 oom events, and 2 existed fleet-wide ever.
 *
 * cgroup v2 exposes a monotonic `oom_kill` counter per cgroup (readable from inside the
 * container), so we poll it and treat a positive delta as fresh kill(s). Trade-off: the
 * counter is just a number — no victim name or RSS (dmesg had those, but is dead here).
 * Attribution is the cgroup the kill landed in (e.g. the agent's own slice, which holds
 * the workspace processes). Pure parse + diff so it's tested without a kernel; the
 * actual /sys/fs/cgroup walk is injected by the caller (see server.ts).
