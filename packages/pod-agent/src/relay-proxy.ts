/**
 * The pod-side relay proxy: a localhost SOCKS5 endpoint that apps point
 * `PODWAY_RELAY_PROXY` at. Every CONNECT is carried over the control link to the owner's
 * relay, which dials the target from THEIR network — so a crawler keeps its live DOM and
 * its recipes, and only its egress address changes.
 *
 * Two invariants this file exists to hold:
 *  - **Fail closed.** With no relay connected the CONNECT is refused with a clean SOCKS
 *    error. It must never hang, and must never quietly fall back to the pod's own
 *    (datacenter) egress — an app would then think the relay worked.
 *  - **Never the owner's LAN.** A target that is a private/loopback literal is refused
 *    here, before anything is dialed (the owner's relay re-checks after DNS).
 *
 * The transport is injected, so the whole server is testable against a fake relay with no
 * gateway, no owner, and no network.
