/**
 * Replaces the `coldStart` boolean for deciding whether the greeter should
 * `/rename` the Claude-app remote-control session to the pod's title.
 *
 * `coldStart` was derived from "did the pod-agent PROCESS restart", but the
 * tmux-hosted Claude process — and therefore the RC session it owns — can
 * survive a pod-agent-only restart (a service bounce). In that case the OLD
 * logic (`coldStart: true` on every boot greet) would send `/rename` again
 * even though it's the SAME RC session, and could clobber a title the owner
 * set themselves in the Claude app in the meantime.
 *
 * The fix: observe the RC session's own identity (Claude Code's
 * `bridgeSessionId`, surfaced by `signals.ts`'s `sessionStateFromDisk().url`)
 * and persist only a HASH of the last-observed one — never the raw id/URL,
 * per the design's privacy-adjacent constraint (a live session identifier is
 * sensitive even in Podway's own file). Comparing the current observation
 * against the persisted hash tells us whether the RC session's identity
 * actually changed, independent of whether the pod-agent process restarted.
 *
 * See openspec/changes/rc-reconnect-hardening/design.md, decision 3.

 *
 * - same id as last time  → same RC session survived (e.g. a pod-agent-only restart, or a
 *   native `--continue` reattach) → do NOT rename; preserve whatever title is already there.
 * - different id, or no prior hash → a fresh or replacement RC session → RENAME, and persist
 *   the new id's hash so the next comparison is against this session.
 * - no CURRENT observable id, but ALSO no prior hash → there is nothing a rename could
 *   clobber (we have never recorded a session for this pod), and the greeter only reaches
 *   the rename step at all once it has confirmed RC is ACTIVE — which it accepts from the
 *   PANE (`RC_ACTIVE_RE`) as well as from the session file. That asymmetry is a real window,
 *   not a hypothetical: the pane can read "remote control is active · …/session_x" before
 *   `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` exists for `sessionStateFromDisk()` to parse. Skipping
 *   the rename there would silently drop the whole point of the cold-restart naming fix
 *   (a fresh session left as "Resume session context"), so RENAME as best effort — with no
 *   hash to persist, since we still have no id to record. Caught by CI's real-tmux
 *   `greeter.test.ts`, which this sandbox cannot run (2026-08-27).
 * - no CURRENT observable id, but a prior hash EXISTS → we have previously recorded a
 *   session for this pod and cannot prove the current one differs, so a rename risks
 *   clobbering a title the owner set. Do NOT rename, and leave the persisted hash alone.
