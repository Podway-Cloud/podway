 *  - **memory / disk** take the LAST value: they are levels, not rates, and the

 *  - **agentStatus** takes "busy" if the agent was busy at ANY point in the bucket —
 *    an hour containing work is not an idle hour.
 *
 * A bucket with no samples is NOT emitted. Gaps are real (a suspended pod records
 * nothing) and the charts draw them as breaks; inventing zero-filled buckets would
 * turn "we weren't running" into "we were running and doing nothing".
