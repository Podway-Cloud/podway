 * Supervision for the pod's long-running NON-agent processes: the dev server and the

 * `nohup` — which means an OOM kill (or any crash) mid-run left them dead until the next
 * reboot: the preview went dark, workers silently vanished, and the only "recovery" was
 * the owner noticing. The agent itself is already watchdog-supervised; this extends the
 * same repair-policy loop (capped, backed off, attributed to OOM when one was just seen)
 * to everything else the pod is supposed to keep running.
 *
 * Semantics: STRICTLY "restart what died", never "start what never started". A process is
 * only respawned when its pidfile EXISTS and the pid is dead — a missing pidfile means
 * boot hasn't launched it yet (or the entry is new and unstarted), and racing init.sh at
 * boot would double-start it. Entries removed or disabled in startup.json are never
 * resurrected: the supervisor re-reads the declaration each pass.
 *
 * Pure parsing/assessment here; the spawn glue takes injected deps so it's testable.
