 * Pure so the RULES can be unit-tested without a live pod — the failure mode that
 * matters here is a check that stays quiet while the pod is broken (a false green
 * is worse than no check at all), and that is exactly what tests can pin.
 *
 * Two deliberate constraints:
 *  - **Green is empty.** No issue is emitted for a passing check; a healthy pod
 *    returns `[]` so surfaces can render nothing rather than a wall of green rows.
 *  - **Severity means treatment**, not drama: `critical` = the pod is unusable or
 *    about to be, `warn` = degraded and worth acting on, `info` = worth knowing in
 *    a report but not worth interrupting anyone.
