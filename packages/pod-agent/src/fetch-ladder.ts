/**
 * Climb the fetch ladder once, for one URL, and say what happened.
 *
 * Pure orchestration: every rung is injected, so the decision logic — which rungs to
 * try, in what order, when to stop, what to report, what to tell the caller when
 * nothing worked — is testable with no network and no browser. The IO lives at the
 * call site, which is thin by design.
 *
 * The reason this exists as a command rather than instructions in a skill: with
 * instructions, each agent hand-rolls the ladder differently and the verifier is
 * ADVISORY — the agent may or may not apply it. Here it is enforced, so a block page
 * cannot be returned as content no matter who is driving.
