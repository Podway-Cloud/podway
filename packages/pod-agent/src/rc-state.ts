/**
 * Is the RC-off sentinel an ORPHAN — present with no external harness to justify it?
 *
 * `CLAUDE_RC_OFF` means "T3 (an external harness) drives Claude here", and every Podway RC path
 * returns early on it: the greeter, the fail-state watchdog, `reenableRemoteControl`, and
 * `/agent/rc-restore`. That is correct while T3 really is in control — and catastrophic when it
 * isn't, because the pod then has NO remote control AND no resume nudge on every restart, forever,
 * with no error anywhere. The only symptom the owner sees is "my agent stopped greeting me after a
 * restart".
 *
 * It strands pods because BOTH removal paths are best-effort: `clearT3Failure`'s rollback issues
 * `execRcYield(…, false)` as a `curl … || true` (swallows failure in the shell) wrapped in a
 * `.catch(() => undefined)` (swallows it again in TS). One missed call during a failed T3 enable —
 * exactly when the pod is least healthy — leaves the marker behind permanently. Observed on podway
 * `first10`: marker written 2026-08-23T15:25:26Z by a T3 enable that ended `t3Stage="error"`, still
 * there 2026-08-29 with `t3Control=false`, an EMPTY `startup.json` and no t3 process.
 *
 * Safe to clear because of ordering: a real handover runs `podway startup add --slug t3-code`
 * BEFORE `execRcYield(…, true)` writes the marker (`startT3Enable`), and the entry is durable
 * across restarts. So "marker present, `t3-code` entry absent" is never a legitimate state — it can
 * only mean the harness never registered or was already torn down. Deliberately keyed to the
 * durable registration and NOT to a live process, so a pod that reboots with T3 legitimately
 * enabled (entry present, `t3 serve` not up yet) is never mistaken for an orphan.
