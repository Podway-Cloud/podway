/**
 * The CURRENT env-declared first-boot setup milestone (see
 * openspec/changes/add-deploy-progress/design.md) — a generic marker convention so ANY
 * environment can surface its own deploy progress without the platform parsing app-specific
 * output. Present only WHILE setup is actively running: `~/.podway-setup-running` exists and
 * `~/.podway-setup-done` does not (mirrors boot.ts's WAIT_FOR_SETUP gate). Older images/envs
 * that never write either marker file correctly read as "setup not running" → null.
 *
 * Prefers the bare message in `~/.podway-progress` (the unambiguous "current" value an env or
 * its `progress()` helper keeps up to date); else falls back to the LAST
 * `podway-progress: <message>` line in `~/.podway-setup.log` (init.sh tees all setup-step
 * stdout/stderr there verbatim, no prefixing). Returns null once setup is done or no marker was
 * ever emitted (an env that opts out is unaffected). Sanitized like every other `/healthz`
 * string so this can never smuggle raw log content or a secret past the health boundary.
