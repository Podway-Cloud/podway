/**
 * Pure classifier for the RC lifecycle model (openspec/changes/rc-reconnect-hardening/design.md,
 * decision 2): `active` | `recovering` | `down` | `login-required` | `unknown`. Health reporting,
 * automatic recovery, and doctor all consume this ONE classifier so they cannot disagree — these
 * tests are the exhaustive scenario list from the delta spec (`rc-reconnect-hardening/specs/pod-agent/spec.md`,
 * "Requirement: Claude Remote Control lifecycle state is current and classified").
 *
 * `input` fields are pre-derived signals (authed/expired from `credentialState`, `liveAuthFailure`
 * from `authFailureInPane`, `gate` from `classifyGate`, `hasSessionUrl` a BOOLEAN never the URL
 * itself, `recovering`/`recoveryGaveUp` from the pod-agent's bounded auto-restore tracking, and
 * `rcYielded` from `existsSync(CLAUDE_RC_OFF)`) — this function does no I/O of its own.
