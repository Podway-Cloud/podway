/**
 * Routes egress-tunnel streams between a pod and its owner's relay.
 *
 * The pod opens a stream with an id of its own; the gateway pairs it with a
 * gateway-minted id and only ever addresses the relay with that. A pod therefore cannot
 * name — or hijack — a sibling's stream, the same reason relay fetch ids are minted here.
 *
 * This is also where the platform-side guards live, because the pod cannot be trusted to
 * enforce anything against itself:
 *  - the target host is taken from the CONNECT, and a private/loopback target is refused
 *    (the ONE shared SSRF check, so pod and gateway can never drift);
 *  - concurrency is capped per pod and per owner, so one pod cannot exhaust the relay;
 *  - new connections are capped per domain per minute, to protect the SOURCE from being
 *    hammered in the owner's name;
 *  - a refused stream is never counted against the rate budget (a refusal is not use).
 *
 * Metering is domain-level only — connections and bytes, never a path, never content.
