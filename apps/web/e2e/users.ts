 * Naming defaults only — NOT a connection string.

 * There used to be a `url` getter here with hardcoded local-Postgres coordinates,
 * described as "fixed ephemeral-Postgres coordinates". It never matched reality: global-setup starts
 * `new PostgreSqlContainer(...)` with no fixed port binding, so testcontainers assigns a RANDOM host
 * port and its own credentials, and passes that real URL to the app as DATABASE_URL. Anything using
 * the constant therefore connected to a dead port — `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:54329`, which failed
 * cockpit.spec.ts's walkthrough test on every CI run and read as a mystery "e2e flake" (it blocked
 * PR #49, 2026-08-27).
 *
 * The getter is deliberately gone rather than corrected: no constant CAN name a random port. Tests
 * needing their own connection read `dbUrl` from `.e2e-state.json` (see helpers.ts).
