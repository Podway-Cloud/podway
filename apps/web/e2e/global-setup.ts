/**
 * Compile the heavy routes ONCE, before any test can be charged for it.
 *
 * This suite runs `next dev`, which compiles a route on its first request. The cockpit
 * (`/dashboard/pods/[slug]`) is the biggest route in the app, and `launch-configure`
 * calls `router.push` INSIDE a transition — so the URL does not change until that first
 * compile finishes. Every pod-launching test therefore paid the whole cold compile
 * inside its own `waitForURL` budget, and on a constrained pod (no Docker, so this is
 * where the suite actually runs) it lost: 6 of 7 cockpit tests failed, with the failing
 * SET drifting run to run, which reads as flakiness rather than a fixed cost.
 *
 * Warming here is honest about what it is — a compile, not a test — and it fixes the
 * whole class: any route added to this list stops being a first-test tax.
 *
 * Auth does not matter. A redirect still compiles the route, which is the point; so
 * every response (302, 404, even 500) is fine and the status is deliberately ignored.
