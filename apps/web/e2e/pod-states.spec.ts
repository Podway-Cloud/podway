/**
 * Edge states the happy-path specs never reach: ownership 404s, the pending gate's
 * actual content, and sign-out.
 *
 * NOT covered here (deferred, see docs/plans/e2e-coverage-plan.md area 6): the
 * launch-FAILED and env-gone error screens, and provisioning-disabled buttons. Driving a
 * pod into `status=error` hermetically means failing the provisioner and waiting out its
 * retry/backoff — slow and flaky — and provisioning-disabled needs the whole server
 * booted with it off. Both want a fixture, not a live drive.
