/**
 * Agent HARNESSES are external apps that take control of a pod's CLIs over their own relay — T3 Code
 * today, and later grok/opencode/cursor. Each is gated by this per-harness flag so we can turn one off
 * (hidden from every enable surface) without deleting its code, and turn it back on by flipping the
 * env. Shaped per-harness from day one so a new CLI is an additive `AgentHarness` value, not a rewrite.
 *
 * `PODWAY_AGENT_HARNESS` semantics:
 *   - UNSET  → every known harness ON (the default; shipping this gate changes nothing).
 *   - a comma list ("t3", "t3,grok", …) → ONLY those on (case/space tolerant).
 *   - "" or "none" → all off.
 * To DISABLE T3, set it to a list that omits `t3` (or "" / "none").
 *
 * Pure (reads only process.env) so it unit-tests without a server context — unlike `editionOss` in the
 * server-only session module, whose result is threaded the same way.
