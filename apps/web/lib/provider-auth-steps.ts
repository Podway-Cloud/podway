/**
 * The ONE source of truth for provider sign-in (t3-unattended-integration, D6). Sign-in is not "a T3
 * thing" or "a launch thing" — it is "bring each chosen provider to the auth state this pod's mode
 * needs." Every entry point (launch, switch-to-T3, cockpit add-provider, renew/expiry) computes its
 * steps here and feeds the ONE ProviderAuthWizard, so there is no duplicated sign-in flow.
 *
 * A "provider" is an agent CLI (T3's term): claude-code, codex, and later cursor/grok/opencode.
 * Pure + no React → trivially unit-tested (which is the point — the branching is where bugs hide).
