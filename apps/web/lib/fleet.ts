/**
 * Fleet view for the backoffice (docs/plans/observability-plan.md, pre-alpha P1).
 *
 * Everything here answers a question we had to answer BY HAND during the
 * 2026-07-17 dogfood — which is the whole argument for building it:
 *  - "has this pod ever slept?"  → REMOVED 2026-07-29. It detected a 5h compute
 *                                   leak back when pods idle-slept; the
 *                                   2026-07-20 pivot made Incus pods run 24/7
 *                                   (the idle sweep skipped them, and was deleted
 *                                   entirely on 2026-09-04), so
 *                                   "never slept" became true of every healthy
 *                                   pod. A signal that fires on the whole fleet
 *                                   is a signal nobody reads. The real question
 *                                   now is "awake and doing nothing", which the
 *                                   agent-activity share answers.
 *  - "what version is each pod?"  → finding stale pods meant eyeballing digests.
 *  - "is anything duplicated/orphaned?" → one pod had 3 machines, all billing.
