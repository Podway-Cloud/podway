/**
 * How much of a pod's awake time its agent was actually WORKING.
 *
 * Derived from the metric samples we already collect — each carries the agent's
 * own reported state — so this costs nothing new to gather. It answers the
 * question uptime cannot: a pod can be up for ten hours and have done nothing,
 * and "awake 10h" reads like activity when it is really just billing.
 *
 * The shares are weighted by TIME, not by sample count. That distinction became
 * load-bearing when history went tiered: a sample from the hourly tier stands for
 * 60× the time of a sample from the minute tier, so counting samples would let a
 * recent busy minute outweigh a quiet hour. On a 30-day view the last 24h supplies
 * a third of the samples while covering 3% of the span.
 *
 * `busy` and `shell` are both work — the agent thinking vs. the agent running a
 * command — and are reported apart because "it's been shelling out for an hour" and
 * "it's been thinking for an hour" mean different things when you're debugging.
 * `waiting` means waiting on the USER, which is neither working nor idle; counting
 * it as either would flatter or libel the pod.
