      <h2>What cookies are</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small files a site stores in your browser. Some are needed for the site to work;
        others help us understand how the app is used. We keep our use minimal.
      </p>

      <h2>Strictly-necessary cookies (always on)</h2>
      <p>
        These are required for Podway to function, so they don&rsquo;t need consent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Session cookie</strong> — keeps you signed in (set by our authentication).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookie-choice cookie</strong> (<code>pb-cookie-consent</code>) — remembers whether
          you accepted or declined analytics, so we don&rsquo;t ask again.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Landing A/B testing (first-party)</h2>
      <p>
        On our landing page we test different versions to see which explains Podway best. This uses
        two first-party cookies — <code>pb_landing_visitor</code> (a random id, so you see a
        consistent version) and <code>pb_landing_..._variant</code> (which version you saw) — and we
        count views and sign-ups <strong>on our own servers</strong>. No third party is involved and
        no data leaves Podway. We treat this as a first-party functional/measurement use under our
        legitimate interest in improving the site; you can opt out by declining analytics below or by
        clearing these cookies.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics cookies (only with your consent)</h2>
      <p>
        With your consent, we use <strong>PostHog</strong> for product analytics — to see which
        features are used and where the app is slow, so we can improve it. Until you accept, PostHog
        runs in a cookieless, no-capture mode and sets <strong>no</strong> analytics cookies. When you
        accept, it stores analytics identifiers to recognise your browser across sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to understand traffic and which pages people
        reach. It runs in Google&rsquo;s <em>Consent Mode</em> with storage defaulted to{" "}
        <strong>denied</strong>, so until you accept it sets <strong>no</strong> analytics cookies
        (<code>_ga</code>, <code>_ga_*</code>). When you accept, those cookies are used to measure
        visits and distinguish returning browsers. Declining, or clearing your cookie choice, stops
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We deliberately limit what analytics can see: the pod terminal and secret inputs are excluded
        from any session recording, outbound events are scrubbed of credential-shaped values, and the
        fleet&rsquo;s fetch-memory stores only a domain — never a URL, page content, or who asked.
      </p>

      <h2>The support chat</h2>
      <p>
        Our in-app support chat (also PostHog) uses storage to keep your conversation with us. If you
        decline analytics, the support widget still works when you open it, but your ticket may be
        scoped to that browser session.
      </p>

      <h2>Managing your choice</h2>
      <p>
        You choose when the cookie banner appears. To change your mind later, clear the{" "}
        <code>pb-cookie-consent</code> cookie in your browser (or all Podway cookies) and reload —
        the banner will reappear so you can choose again. You can also block or delete cookies in your
        browser settings; strictly-necessary cookies may be needed for sign-in to work.
      </p>

        why.
