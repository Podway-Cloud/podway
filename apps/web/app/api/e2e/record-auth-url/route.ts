 * E2E ONLY — simulate the greeter recording a pod's sign-in URL (Claude) or device code
 * (Codex), exactly the way the gateway does when it scrapes the agent's login output. There
 * is no real greeter behind a fake pod, so the onboarding sign-in step can't otherwise be
 * reached. Hard-gated on PODWAY_TEST_LOGIN (the same flag the e2e login uses); a 404 in any
 * environment where that isn't set, so it cannot exist in production.
 *
 * Owner-scoped: the pod is resolved through the signed-in user's own service, so a caller
 * can only ever touch their own pod.
