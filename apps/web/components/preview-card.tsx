/**
 * The pod's live preview, as a browser-window card rather than a lone button in an
 * empty row (owner feedback, 2026-07-29).
 *
 * The frame is a REAL live view, not a screenshot: the preview host is a subdomain
 * of the dashboard's own domain, so it is same-site and the owner's session cookie
 * rides along — an owner-only preview frames fine in the owner's browser (an
 * unauthenticated request gets 401, which is the point).
 *
 * Built so the card still reads correctly if the frame never paints (app not
 * started, crashed, still building): the chrome bar carries the URL, the state
 * line says what's expected, and Open is the authoritative action WHEN there is
 * something to open. A blank rectangle should never be the only thing this says —
 * and Open is hidden when nothing is serving, so it never leads to a dead page
 * (matches the dashboard card, which hides its preview button the same way).
