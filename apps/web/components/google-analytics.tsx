// GA4 measurement ID is PUBLIC by design (it ships in the client HTML on every page), so it is safe
// to keep here. It lives in CODE rather than a Fly secret on purpose: NEXT_PUBLIC_* is inlined at
// BUILD time, so a runtime secret would never reach the client bundle and analytics would silently
// stay on the old property. Override with NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID only where it is set at build.
//
// 2026-09-06: repointed to the podway.io property. The previous value (G-5044P4GF1X) was the
// pre-rename property, so every visit since the domain flip was being recorded against the old one.

/**
 * Google Analytics 4, wired through the SAME cookie-consent gate as PostHog
 * (see instrumentation-client.ts + consent-banner.tsx) so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * We use GA **Consent Mode v2**: every storage type defaults to `denied`, so gtag sets
 * NO analytics/ad cookies and sends only cookieless signals until the visitor accepts.
 * The inline script reads the first-party consent cookie AT RUNTIME (not at SSR, which
 * can't see it) and flips `analytics_storage` to granted for a returning visitor who
 * already accepted; the consent banner flips it live on Accept/Decline via `window.gtag`.
 *
 * Loaded only in production, so dev/preview traffic never pollutes the GA property.
