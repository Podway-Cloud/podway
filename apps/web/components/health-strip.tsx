 * Pod-level health, shown ONLY when something is wrong.
 *
 * Green is invisible on purpose: the cockpit's happy path is the agent-card stack,
 * and a permanent "all good" banner trains people to ignore the one place we will
 * later need them to look. The strip's presence IS the signal.
 *
 * Per-agent problems are deliberately not rendered here — they belong on that
 * agent's card, which already has a state machine for them. This carries what has
 * no other home: disk, session, scheduler, and "automatic repair gave up".
 * `info` issues stay out of the cockpit entirely; they live in the Admin list.
